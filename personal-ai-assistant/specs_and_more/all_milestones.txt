Implementation Strategy

Phase 1 - Smart Data Router (4-6 weeks): Build the core prompt analysis engine that can understand intent and route to appropriate data sources. Start with basic email/calendar integration.

Phase 2 - Trigger System (3-4 weeks): Add the proactive monitoring with simple time-based triggers. Users can create their first saved searches.

Phase 3 - Learning Engine (6-8 weeks): Implement the pattern recognition that makes data fetching smarter over time based on user behavior.

Phase 4 - Advanced Intelligence (ongoing): Continuously add new data sources and improve the semantic understanding.

Immediate Validation Approach

Want to test this concept right now? You could:

1. Define Your First Triggers:
     - "Weekly investor follow-up review"
    - "Daily strategic priority optimization"
    - "Urgent email response alerts"

2. Test with Real Data:
     - Give me access to your email/calendar
    - I'll simulate these triggers manually
    - Show you exactly what insights would be generated

3. Refine the Prompts:
     - Iterate on what data points are most valuable
    - Optimize the trigger frequency and conditions
    - Define the action-oriented output format you prefer

This would let you validate the core value proposition and define the exact prompt templates before building anything. The beauty is that once you nail the prompt formulas that work for you, scaling to other users becomes a matter of helping them create their own personalized trigger sets.
